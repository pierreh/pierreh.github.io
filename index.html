                    <p>
                        With 25 years of experience in Software Engineering across multiple industries I am capable of taking on new assignments and technologies with ease. 
                        I easily adapt to new situations, acquire new knowledge quickly and am able to transfer that to others. 
                        My strength is to digest complex functional requirements and build a solid and clean codebase.
                        By having been self-employed for over half a decade I understand the need to focus on business value at all times.

                            At Move Work Forward I have helped modernizing the UI of their Atlassian integrations with React and made integrations with Typeform and Mixpanel 
                            on the backend on AWS. Created a survey result processing backend with Typescript, Node, Serverless & AWS Lambda. Integrated eslint in to our Cloud Apps
                            Monorepo. Greatly reduced deployment size of Lambda functions. Reduced cold start time for Lambda functions by at least 80%.

                            Here I worked on the frontend development using their in-house web development framework and React. 
                            Over the course of 2 years we managed to migrate most of the code to React. 
                            I also worked on the refactoring of the billing system to implement new Payment plans and allow for easy upgrades and downgrades of these plans. 
                            The billing system is a complex beast with many intricate business rules and it is imperative those rules are not broken. 
                            We were able to deliver this project with zero downtime and no significant bugs in the system and immediately resulted in an increase in paid plans

                            Being initially hired as a frontend engineer, I soon also started working on the Java backend and initiated projects in Node.js and AWS Lambda. 
                            After having been supporting the onboarding team for a while I became responsible for upgrading our platform so that the onboarding team could set up clients without the need of Engineering. 
                            It was a massive collaborative effort between engineering teams, onboarding and client services that I had to coordinate. 
                            It was delivered on time and it was a great success. After this I continued to be responsible for multiple projects as well as assisting the Team Manager.

                            The system is complex and has a long history that contains in depth domain knowledge. The largest part of the software runs in Jboss/Wildfly EAP, which is a Java EE container. 
                            I delivered a fully automated deployment system to be able to deploy and migrate their complete set of software to the Azure Cloud, which had been running on custom servers before.

                        <div class="description">I helped build a Java Enterprise web application that communicates in real-time with the on-board computer of a fleet of trucks, processes the datastream and makes the information visible, also in real-time. 
                            The current location of all the trucks is displayed on the map along with its route, assigments, speeds, etc. By using the Google Web Toolkit the browser was being pushed to the limits.
                            I was responsible for building custom GWT widgets that can display the vast realtime data with high performance. As well as processing the large amounts of data on the backend.
